Duke Professors info --> csv

###CSV File Format
One entry per professor per department. That is, if a professor teaches in more than one department, 
then there will be an entry for that professor for each department. 

`<FIRSTNAME>, <LASTNAME>, <TITLE>, <DEPT>`

This format is followed in `master.csv` and all respective department files in `/depts/`.
