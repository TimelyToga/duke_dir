Duke Professors info --> tsv

###TSV File Format
One entry per professor per department. That is, if a professor teaches in more than one department, 
then there will be an entry for that professor for each department.

`<FIRSTNAME>    <MIDDLEINITIAL>    <LASTNAME>    <TITLE>    <DEPT>`

This format is followed in `master.csv` and all respective department files in `/depts/`.
